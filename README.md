# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Routing Behavior with Dynamic Segments

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic segments.  The issue involves inconsistent routing or unexpected page rendering when navigating to routes with specific parameters.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file shows a simple Next.js 15 app with a route that includes a dynamic segment.  However, this route doesn't behave as expected in some scenarios. This could manifest as incorrect page rendering, redirection to unexpected pages, or complete failure to load the expected content. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
